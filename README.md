# Etherium-address-tres
The project uses Web3.js and Node.js to track pecding transactions as well as transaction son the latest etherium block for all transactions associated with a specific test account.
Technologies used: Web3.js, Infura, Node.js, Block chain Knowledge
The project checks for all transactions to a particullar test account on the Etherium network.
There are two project s which are two different approaches to this problem

The first: This one checks through the latest block on the network and compares the transaction to address with the given address

The second: This method uses the Subscribe feature of the web3.js Library to get a list of all pending transactions and checks the transactioons associated with those transaction hasehes to check for an address match.

To start the project run :
npm install, 
create an env file to contain the variables in the env.sample file.
